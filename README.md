# pooled-pg

A driver to PostgreSQL that is compatible with [pg](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/),
with more effective pooling strategies.

## Installation

Use npm:

    $ npm install pooled-pg

To run as a server, please install globally:

    $ sudo npm install -g pooled-pg

## Basic Usage: Pooled Mode

Basic usage is as simple as with [pg](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/):

Since pooled-pg is designed to be compatible with pg, just replace `pg` with `pooled-pg`
and voil√†!
The pooling is done using `generic-pool` which should be a bit more robust than `pg`'s own pooling,
which according to [pg's author](http://blog.argteam.com/coding/node-js-postgres-pooling-revisited-with-transactions/)
is not 100% reliable.

### `pg.connect()`

In the following line, change `pg`:

	var pg = require('pg');
    pg.connect(address, callback);

to `pooled-pg`, so that it looks like this:

	var pooled = require('pooled-pg');
    pooled.connect(address, callback);

You can call the driver `pg`, but we change it here to `pooled` to avoid confusion.
Full example:

```
var pooled = require('pooled-pg');
var address = 'postgresql://user:password@server:5432/database';
pooled.connect(address, function(error, client, done)
{
	client.query('select current_user', function(error, result)
	{
		done();
		console.log('Current user: %s', result.rows[0].current_user);
	});
});
```

### `pg.Client()`

If you were using pg `Client`, just use `pooled-pg's Client`:

    var client = new pooled.Client(address);

The rest of you code will remain the same. Your connections are now pooled!

## Advanced Usage: Remote Mode

Sometimes the normal usage for the [pg](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/) driver is not enough.
If you have more than a few hundred connections, PostgreSQL does not behave nicely.
In those situations pooled-pg has a new, more interesting usage mode:
install a daemon on the PostgreSQL server which pools the connections,
and use a remote light client that connects to the daemon.

### Daemon

On the PostgreSQL server install `pooled-pg` globally:

    $ sudo npm install -g pooled-pg

And then start a server, by default on port 5433:

    $ pooled-server

You will probably want to set up an init or Upstart script to keep it running across reboots.

### Remote Connections

To connect from your frontend servers you just need to modify the connection string
so that it starts with `remote:` instead of `postgresql:`, and change the port. As simple as that!
The change has been designed so that it can be done using only configuration values,
and therefore allows for easy experimentation to see which options is more performant.

Full example:

```
var pooled = require('pooled-pg');
var address = 'remote://user:password@server:5433/database';
pooled.connect(address, function(error, client, done)
{
	client.query('select current_user', function(error, result)
	{
		done();
		console.log('Current user: %s', result.rows[0].current_user);
	});
});
```

### Loadtest Your Server

If you want to see how your server behaves, you can use the command `pooled-loadtest`:

    $ pooled-loadtest remote://user:password@server:5432/database -n 10000

for a pooled server, or for a remote setup:

    $ pooled-loadtest remote://user:password@server:5432/database -n 10000

Check out some more options with:

    $ pooled-loadtest --help

### Caveats of Remote Mode

A few remarks are in order.

The remote mode is now able to send and receive messages longer than a TCP packet.
The protocol has changed in version 0.0.4; please do not mix 0.0.3 server with 0.0.4 remotes or viceversa.

If you use `pooled-pg` in remote mode, keep in mind that the user and password for PostgreSQL
are travelling in the clear;
using a VPN between both machines would be the absolute minimum security required.
